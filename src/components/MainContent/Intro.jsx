            <p>Hello, my name is Kevin, graduated <u>HBSc Bioinformatics specialist and Computer Science minor</u> from University of Toronto. </p>
            <p>Currently pursuing and finishing up my <u>MSc</u> at University of Montreal in Veterinary Science of <u>Microbiology</u>.</p>
            <p>I deal with bacterial genomics on a daily basis. To put it simply, I digitally inspect the nucleotides (ATCGs) that make up an organism and determine what the hell is going on in there. Are they virulent? Resistant to antibiotics? Phylogenetically similar to other species? That is not all though, at any given time or projects, times that by 200-1000 for each bacterial isolate that we receive. <u>Facilitating the analysis of large set of genomic data is important</u>.</p>
            <p>Beyond genomics, I've also worked with multiple domains of bioinformatics: from programming a simple bioinformatics pipeline in Python or Bash, simulation of ligand binding to the catalytic site of a protein, deriving hypothetical protein function based on limited information. The list goes on...</p>
            <p>To keep it short, I am:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <u>bioinformatician</u> focused on <u>microbial genomics</u>.</li>
                <li>Experienced in advanced <u>Linux</u> workflows.</li>
                <li>Applying <u>computational methods</u> to support genomics research.</li>
            </ul>
